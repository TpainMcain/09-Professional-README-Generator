## Description
This app uses Node.js to create a README.md file. The content is based on responses to a series of prompts that are captured using NPM Inquirer.
  
## Installation Instructions
  ### Node.js installation
  Verify node.js installed on your computer by opening a terminal and typing node -v in the command line. If successful, the command prompt will return a version number. If not, try reinstalling Node.js by following this link: https://nodejs.org/en/.
  ###  Download or clone the code
  Click on the green code button to download or clone this repository. Extract the files and open with your favorite code editor.
  ### Inquirer
  Inquirer is an npm package instead of being built directly into node.js. To install, navigate to index.js in the terminal and type npm i -y.
  
## Usage Instructions
* To create a README, open the terminal navigate to the directory that index.js is in.
* Next, type node index into the command-line and you will be prompted with a series of questions.
* Respond to the questions and press enter. Repeat this process for the rest of the questions. Pressing enter saves the response and returns the next question. Once the response is saved, you cannot go back and edit it, however, once the README.md file is generated, you can edit the content in your code editor.
* Once all the questions have been answered, you will be prompted with a message that says "Your README has been successfully created!" in the command line. You can view your new README.md in the explorer tab in your code editor.
